# Welcome To Team Hack!

## What is Team Hack? 

This is a cool open source foundation where you can improve your coding skills.  We are 100% remote.  Monthly we meet up via a Zoom call and talk about projects and ideas we want to code out together.  We use this foundation as a place to help ourselves get better at coding especially for the real world, including common projects we have at work like building landing pages, dashboards, admin panels, and more.   

Additionally we try out new frameworks and the latest in technologies available to build out our code.  Feel free to join us via https://teamhack.org (and learn more about us too).  Team Hack is affilliated with [JavaScriptLA](https://javascriptla.net), which is a meetup group that meets monthly (also online) and helps people get better at full stack development especially with JavaScript.  That said, Team Hack is not limited to just JavaScript the language.   We want to use this space to use all sorts of cool languages including Python, Swift, Go and more.   

Over time we will be improving this README, but that's really the gist.  Feel free to join JavaScriptLA's [Slack](https://javascriptla.herokuapp.com) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/WMBTHXx) if you have more questions, and in time we will have more updates here.
